# Responsable Formation Styles

This folder contains the isolated styles for the Responsable Formation profile pages. These styles are completely separate from the main application styles to ensure that the Responsable Formation profile has its own unique look and feel.

## Usage

The styles in this folder are imported only in the ResponsableFormationLayout component and are scoped to the `.responsable-formation-profile` class to prevent them from affecting other parts of the application.

## Structure

- `styles.css`: The main CSS file containing all the styles for the Responsable Formation profile.

## Guidelines

1. All styles for the Responsable Formation profile should be added to this folder.
2. All styles should be scoped with the `.responsable-formation-profile` class to prevent them from affecting other parts of the application.
3. Do not import these styles in any component outside of the Responsable Formation profile.
4. Do not import global styles in the Responsable Formation components.
